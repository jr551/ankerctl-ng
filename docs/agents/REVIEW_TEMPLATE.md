# Review Report

Use this template when Claude reviews a Codex completion report.
Save alongside the completion report:
`docs/agents/reports/<same-date>-<phase>-review.md`

**After review is complete** (verdict = `approved` or `approved-with-fixes`):
move both the completion report and this review report to `docs/archive/agent-reports/`.
This keeps `docs/agents/reports/` as the inbox for reports that still need a review.

## Compact Feedback Format (for Codex iteration)

When sending findings back to Codex for fixes, use this shorter format
as the `--task` argument to `agent-context.sh`:

```
REVIEW FEEDBACK for <phase>
VERDICT: needs-rework

FIX REQUIRED:
1. [HOCH] server.go:134 — httpServer written without mutex lock.
   Use local var hs, then s.mu.Lock(); s.httpServer = hs; s.mu.Unlock()

2. [MITTEL] security.go — Remove X-XSS-Protection, not in Python reference.

PRESERVE:
- auth order in auth.go is correct, do not change
- session HMAC implementation is correct
```
