# Troubleshooting

## Prerequisites

Before troubleshooting, verify that the following are installed:

- **ankerctl** binary or Docker image (see [Installation and Configuration](Installation-and-Configuration))
- **ffmpeg** -- required for the timelapse feature. Docker images include it. For binary installs, install separately:
  - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`
  - macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
  - Windows: download from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
  - Verify: `ffmpeg -version`

## Connection Issues

### Printer not found on LAN

**Symptoms:** PPPP connection fails, no video stream, uploads fail.

**Causes and solutions:**

1. **Printer and server not on same network.** Ensure both are on the same LAN/VLAN. PPPP uses UDP broadcast for discovery on port 32108.

2. **Docker bridge networking.** You must use `network_mode: host` in Docker Compose. Bridge networking blocks UDP broadcasts.

3. **Firewall blocking UDP.** ankerctl binds PPPP sockets to fixed local ports so ufw/conntrack can pass the printer's unicast reply to a broadcast LanSearch. Open all three:

   ```sh
   sudo ufw allow in proto udp to any port 32100
   sudo ufw allow in proto udp to any port 32108
   sudo ufw allow in proto udp to any port 32109
   sudo ufw reload
   ```

   Ports: **32100** = PPPP session, **32108** = server LAN discovery, **32109** = `find_anker` CLI discovery. If the server is already running, the CLI binding 32109 (instead of 32108) avoids `EADDRINUSE`. If you see *"is another ankerctl instance running?"* in the logs, another process already holds one of these ports.

4. **Printer in sleep mode.** Wake the printer and wait a few seconds for discovery.

5. **Wrong printer selected.** If you have multiple printers, check `PRINTER_INDEX` or use the printer selector in the web UI.

### MQTT connection fails

**Symptoms:** No print status updates, cannot send commands, dashboard shows no data.

**Causes and solutions:**

1. **Config not imported.** Upload your `login.json` or log in via the web UI.

2. **Auth token expired.** Re-import `login.json` or log in again. Tokens expire after extended periods.

3. **Network issues.** MQTT connects to Anker's cloud broker on port 8789 (TLS). Ensure outbound TCP 8789 is not blocked.

4. **Region mismatch.** If you moved to a different region, re-import your config to detect the closest API server.

## Web UI Issues

### Cannot access web UI

1. **Check bind address.** Default is `127.0.0.1` (localhost only). For Docker or remote access, set `ANKERCTL_HOST=0.0.0.0`.

2. **Port conflict.** Default port is 4470. Check if another service is using it: `lsof -i :4470` or `ss -tlnp | grep 4470`.

3. **Firewall.** Ensure TCP 4470 is open if accessing from another machine.

### 401 Unauthorized

1. **API key required.** If an API key is configured, you must authenticate. Append `?apikey=your-key` to the URL in your browser.

2. **Session expired.** Clear cookies and re-authenticate with `?apikey=your-key`.

3. **Wrong key.** Double-check the key in `.env` or config. Keys are case-sensitive, minimum 16 characters.

### Video stream not loading

1. **PPPP not connected.** Check the PPPP connection status indicator in the UI. If disconnected, the video stream is unavailable.

2. **Browser codec support.** The video stream is raw H.264. Some browsers may not support inline H.264 playback. Chrome and Firefox work best.

3. **Stall detection.** If no video frames arrive for 15 seconds, the stream is considered stalled. Reload the page to reconnect.

## Print Issues

### Upload fails / times out

1. **File too large.** Check `UPLOAD_MAX_MB` (default 2048 MB). Increase if your G-code files are larger.

2. **PPPP not connected.** File transfer uses the PPPP protocol. Ensure LAN connectivity to the printer.

3. **Upload rate too high.** If uploads fail or corrupt, try reducing `UPLOAD_RATE_MBPS` (default 10). Lower values (5) are more reliable on congested networks.

### Print does not start after upload

1. **"Send and Print" required.** ankerctl sends the file and immediately starts printing. There is no "upload only" queue on the printer.

2. **Printer busy.** If a print is already running, the upload will queue but not start. Pause or cancel the current print first.

### GCode not recognized

1. **Slicer compatibility.** ankerctl works best with PrusaSlicer, OrcaSlicer, SuperSlicer, and Bamboo Studio. Other slicers may produce G-code that the printer does not accept.

2. **File encoding.** Ensure the G-code file is UTF-8 encoded with Unix line endings (LF, not CRLF).

## Timelapse Issues

### Timelapse not recording

1. **Feature disabled.** Set `TIMELAPSE_ENABLED=true` in `.env` or enable via Setup tab.

2. **ffmpeg not installed.** Timelapse requires ffmpeg for video encoding. In Docker, it is included. For binary installs, install it separately and verify with `ffmpeg -version`. See the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section above.

3. **No active print.** Timelapse only records during prints. It starts automatically when a print begins and stops when it ends.

### Timelapse video is empty or very short

1. **Camera not streaming.** If the video stream is unavailable (PPPP disconnected), no frames are captured.

2. **Interval too long.** For short prints, a 30-second interval may capture very few frames. Reduce `TIMELAPSE_INTERVAL_SEC`.

3. **Resume window.** If a print is paused and resumed within 60 minutes, frames are seamlessly appended. If resumed after 60 minutes, a new timelapse starts.

## Notification Issues

### Apprise notifications not arriving

1. **Apprise server unreachable.** Verify `APPRISE_SERVER_URL` points to a running Apprise API server.

2. **Wrong key.** Check `APPRISE_KEY` matches your Apprise configuration.

3. **Events disabled.** Ensure the specific event toggle is set to `true` (e.g., `APPRISE_EVENT_PRINT_FINISHED=true`).

4. **Test first.** Use Setup > Notifications > Send Test to verify the connection.

## Home Assistant Issues

### Entities not appearing in HA

1. **MQTT broker.** Ensure `HA_MQTT_HOST` and `HA_MQTT_PORT` point to your MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto).

2. **Discovery prefix.** Default is `homeassistant`. If your HA uses a different prefix, set `HA_MQTT_DISCOVERY_PREFIX`.

3. **Restart HA.** After enabling ankerctl HA integration, restart Home Assistant to pick up the discovery payloads.

4. **MQTT integration.** Ensure the MQTT integration is installed and configured in Home Assistant.

## Docker Issues

### Container keeps restarting

1. **Config directory.** Ensure the volume mount for `~/.ankerctl` exists and is writable.

2. **Check logs:** `docker logs ankerctl`

3. **Port conflict.** With `network_mode: host`, port 4470 must be available on the host.

### Permission denied on config

1. **Volume ownership.** The config directory must be readable/writable by the container user. Check permissions: `ls -la ~/.ankerctl/`.

2. **SELinux.** On SELinux-enabled systems, add `:z` to volume mounts: `-v ~/.ankerctl:/root/.ankerctl:z`.

## Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for detailed diagnostics:

```sh
ANKERCTL_DEV_MODE=true ./ankerctl webserver
```

This enables:
- Debug tab in the web UI
- State inspector (live JSON dump)
- Service health panel
- Event simulation
- Log viewer
- `/api/debug/*` endpoints

> **Warning:** Do not enable in production. The debug tab exposes internal state.

## Log Files

Set `ANKERCTL_LOG_DIR` to enable file logging:

```sh
ANKERCTL_LOG_DIR=/var/log/ankerctl ./ankerctl webserver
```

Log files can be viewed in the Debug tab (when dev mode is enabled) or directly on disk.
