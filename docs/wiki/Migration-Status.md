## v1.0.0 Release Notes (2026-05-01)

The v1.0.0 release closes the migration. All Phase 17 parity-audit items are
resolved:

- Missing file endpoints implemented (`/api/files/printer`, thumbnail, print)
- Missing MQTT `ct` handlers added (1001, 1006, 1052, 1085, 1086)
- Missing printer-state endpoints implemented (runtime-state, settings-summary, alerts)
- Missing settings/config routes added (filament-service advanced, launcher-bat, import-slicer, history delete)
- Video stall timeout corrected to match Python (5s)
- HomeAssistant device_class fields completed for temperature and time sensors

## Risk Register

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| PPPP UDP asymmetry complex to port | High | Incremental testing, channel-based Wire signaling |
| ECDH login password encryption | Medium | Go stdlib crypto/ecdh; verified curve params |
| ffmpeg subprocess dependency | Low | Same approach as Python (exec.Command) |
| WebSocket streaming semantics | Medium | gorilla/websocket; notify pattern with channels |
| Service lifecycle (ref-counting) | High | Carefully designed ServiceManager with sync patterns |
| Python `__type__` JSON polymorphism | Medium | Custom UnmarshalJSON in Go |
